The Arduino file in this directory, is used to send USART communications to the hoverboard.
Using the example test code that was given in Emanuel Feru's Original Repository, I added code that would allow the robot to arrive at certain geo-coordinates.
This is done using a NEO-6M GPS module and the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors.
